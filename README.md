# Rename Layers

This script renames current layer and its sub layers recursively.

# How to use

## Install and run

Install this script in Illustrator and execute this script with the layer you want to rename selected.

Or you can simply use it by drag and drop a script to Illustrator as it is for experimental use.

## Edit text

When you run the script, the structure of the current layer is added as a text frame.
Edit the layer name included in this text frame to the name you want to replace.

At this time, please be careful not to change the `-` sign that represents the layer structure.

## Rename layers

Once you have finished editing the text, please run the script again with that text frame selected.

The current layer name is changed according to the edited text frame.
